Data representation
===================

RIME uses the same data model both internally and for its GraphQL API, so before diving into either of those it's worth
familiarising yourself with the basics.

   Event and Contact data flow in RIME

Contacts and Events
-------------------
RIME divides data on a mobile device into two primary categories: *events*, which represent a single message, photo,
phone call, etc, and *contacts*, who are originators or recipients of events. Events have different types, and some
events have associated additional categories (for example, a message event will be part of a *session*), but these are
the fundamental types.

Providers: the source of Events
--------------------------------
Internally, RIME's events and contacts are generated by *providers*. A provider takes data from a specific app or system
component and returns Contacts and Events. For example, the third-party text messaging app WhatsApp is supported for
both iOS and Android dumps (as separate Providers).

Event types
-----------
The base Event data type simply contains a provider name and a timestamp, indicating that every event has to "happen" at
a specific point in time. The actual time chosen is provider-specific. For example, a message event's timestamp is the
time it was sent or received, while a photo event's timestamp is the time the photo was taken.

Event is subclassed to provide data-specific information.
